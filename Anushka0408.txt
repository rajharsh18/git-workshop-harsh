Git and Github workshop :
The workshop was organised by 3rd years seniors. It was a really good session. Giving us the practical knowledge about the working of git and github was something valuable being added to our skills.
Seniors were highly cooperative and assisted everyone very well.
Over all it was a really good learning session.
